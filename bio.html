				<p>I'm a junior software engineer, technological tinkerer, and mathematical fanatic. My background is in mathematics and computer science with an academic interest in software design, abstract algebra, and graph theory and a personal interest in programming principles, symbolic logic, and the history of mathematics. My main interest and ambition in software development is to become a master of automation, as I firmly believe automation will define the 21st century as mass production and manufacturing defined the 20th.</p>

				<p>My deepest passion is learning. I'm routinely trying to fulfill my insatiable curiosity. Naturally, I'm constantly reading anything and everything, from coding to mathematics to biology to history. Recently, I've decided to teach myself mechanical and electrical engineering and, as a result, picked up a hobby of dismantling old computers, monitors, TVs, and really anything I can dig up to figure out how all the components work together. In my additional free time, I'm an avid gamer, cinema lover, and recreational musician.</p>

				<p>I received my B.S. in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science from <a href="http://cas.loyno.edu/mathematics">Loyola University New Orleans</a>. As a math major, I was very active member of our chapter of the mathematical honor society Pi Mu Epsilon, taking part in competitions and conventions and giving several lectures both on and off campus. As a computer science minor, I was the only computer science tutor on campus and was one of two students active in helping the department reestablishing the Computer Information Systems major that had been removed after Hurricane Katrina from the groundwork of the Computer Science minor.</p>

				<p>At Loyola, I was privileged to work as <a href="http://cas.loyno.edu/mathematics/research/zero-divisor-graphs">a research assistant with Dr. Ralph Tucci</a>, who was impressed with my innate ability in problem solving. Initially starting as a grant-funded project, I worked with Dr. Tucci for two years, which garnered two academic papers. In our first publication <a href="http://scientificadvances.co.in/admin/img_data/974/images/JANTAA7100121521RyanL.Miller.pdf">Zero-Divisor Graphs of Finite Direct Products of Finite Non-Commutative Rings and Semigroups</a>, I was responsible for the program that tested the result of the paper, which I initially coded in C++ but redid in MATLAB for the paper. For our second paper, Uniqueness of Z<sub>m</sub>, which hasn't yet been published, I proved all results in the paper, had them checked by Dr. Tucci, and typed the paper in LaTeX.</p>
