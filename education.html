				<p>I received my B.S. in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science from <a href="http://cas.loyno.edu/mathematics">Loyola University New Orleans</a>. As a math major, I was very active member of our chapter of the mathematical honor society Pi Mu Epsilon, taking part in competitions and conventions and giving several lectures both on and off campus. As a computer science minor, I was the only computer science tutor on campus and was one of two students active in helping the department reestablishing the Computer Information Systems major that had been removed after Hurricane Katrina from the groundwork of the Computer Science minor.</p>

				<p>At Loyola, I was privileged to work as  <a href="http://cas.loyno.edu/mathematics/research/zero-divisor-graphs">a research assistant with Dr. Ralph Tucci</a>, who was impressed with my innate ability in problem solving. Initially starting as a grant-funded project, I worked with Dr. Tucci for two years, which garnered two academic papers. In our first publication <a href="http://scientificadvances.co.in/admin/img_data/974/images/JANTAA7100121521RyanL.Miller.pdf">Zero-Divisor Graphs of Finite Direct Products of Finite Non-Commutative Rings and Semigroups</a>, I was responsible for the program that tested the result of the paper, which I initially coded in C++ but redid in MATLAB for the paper. For our second paper, Uniqueness of Z<sub>m</sub>, which hasn't yet been published, I proved all results in the paper, had them checked by Dr. Tucci, and typed the paper in LaTeX.</p>
