				<p>As a software developer at a tech start up, I became well-versed in working independently and with a small team to meet strict deadlines no matter what, whether working any amount of extra hours for no extra pay or serving several roles in development, solely out of passion for technology. Additionally, this work venture required me to pick up several new technologies and figure out how they work, mainly regarding software but occasionally hardware too. Some of my contributions included working with Google's Tango and its API, using quaternions to rotate a steering wheel in a virtual reality car, figuring out the Muse EEG device's API to teach one of the other development teams to use for their project, and some very minor dabbling in the Arduino's C++ library for sensors in an automated aeroponics system.</p>

				<p>My biggest contribution was a data visualization platform, which took electromagnetic field data from Remcom's XFdtd software and visualized it in virtual reality. For this project, I constructed a parser to read the vector field data, which was stored from the software as a CVS file. I then established a voxel engine that created custom-built voxels pointing in the appropriate vector directions to visualize the data.</p>

				<p>Since then, I've decided to start fiddling with some automation ideas of my own and picked up mobile app development as a side interest. Two current projects I'm working on are an automated lawnmower and a mobile education app. With the automated lawnmower, I aim to produce the first automated lawnmower that doesn't require any assembly out of the box. My secret recipe: it's also technically bladeless. With the education app, I seek to teach math topics ranging from beginner to advanced since all the current math "education" apps on the market focus almost purely on speed arithmetic and not truly useful knowledge. If the app takes off when it's complete, I plan on branching it into other fields, i.e. physics, chemistry, biology, etc., making it a versatile, all-encompassing source of self-education and/or guidance.</p>
